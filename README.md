# Virutal3D

In this project, I will create a virtual 3 diemsnoal display used for face tracking. More specifically, using the Haar Cascade face tracker from OpenCV to determine a person's X,Y,Z location in relation to a webcam..Then updated the display of a virtual tunnel according to users position so it gives a 3D effect.
